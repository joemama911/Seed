# Adaptive AI for Healthcare: Customizable Disease Prediction Models and Real-Time Health Insights

## Overview
This project provides an AI/ML-driven solution that leverages Llama 3.1â€™s ReAct agent to create customizable predictive models for healthcare. It enables users to generate disease prediction models for specific health conditions based on diverse datasets, supporting informed, data-driven decision-making. With integrated tools for data collection, processing, and personalized health insights, this system can improve patient care by delivering timely, actionable intelligence.

## Problem Statement
Healthcare organizations face several challenges, including:
1. **Data Fragmentation**: Patient data is often dispersed across various systems, making comprehensive analysis difficult.
2. **Lack of Early Detection**: Without predictive models, early detection is hindered, impacting timely intervention.
3. **Limited Personalization**: Existing solutions often lack tailored risk assessments and recommendations, limiting personalized care.
4. **Inefficient Model Development**: Building accurate predictive models requires substantial resources and data, posing challenges for healthcare providers.

## Proposed Solution
This project provides a comprehensive AI-based solution for predictive healthcare models, enabling:
1. **Customizable Disease Prediction Models**: Leveraging Llama 3.1 and the ReAct agent, users can create personalized models based on diverse datasets, with the option to specify model architectures for conditions such as brain tumor prediction.
2. **Deep Research Integration**: Using internet search tools, the system performs extensive research on disease-specific approaches, enhancing model accuracy.
3. **Dynamic Dataset Sourcing**: The Kaggle API automatically sources and downloads relevant datasets, keeping models up-to-date and high quality.
4. **Personalized Health Insights with RAG**: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tool generates tailored health insights, risk assessments, and recommendations based on patient data.

## Key Features
- **Llama 3.1 ReAct Agent**: Acts as the core of the system, coordinating model creation and customization based on user prompts.
- **Python REPL Tool**: Executes code for model training and fine-tuning as per user specifications.
- **Internet Search Tool**: Gathers relevant data from the web, enhancing research depth and model refinement.
- **Kaggle Integration**: Uses the Kaggle API to source high-quality medical datasets.
- **RAG Tool**: Provides health insights and recommendations, improving interpretability and actionability for healthcare providers.

## Implementation Plan
The project will be implemented in four phases:
1. **Tool Development**: Building essential tools, including Python REPL, internet search, Kaggle integration, and RAG.
2. **Agent Access and Optimization**: Enabling tool access for the agent and improving efficiency through prompt engineering.
3. **Data Processing and Model Training**: Enhancing research capabilities, preprocessing data, and refining model training/evaluation workflows.
4. **Agent Deployment**: Deploying the fully functional agent, making it available for real-time healthcare predictions and insights.

## Expected Outcomes
- **Personalized Disease Prediction**: Enable proactive detection of diseases with customized AI models.
- **Informed Decision-Making**: Deliver real-time, research-backed insights for healthcare providers.
- **Efficient Model Development**: Automate data sourcing and training to streamline model creation.
- **Improved Patient Care**: Boost patient satisfaction with tailored health recommendations.
